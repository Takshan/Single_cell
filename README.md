## About Dengue: What You Need to Know

Dengue viruses are spread to people through the bite of an infected Aedes species (Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus) mosquito. These mosquitoes also spread Zika, chikungunya, and other viruses.
Dengue is common in more than 100 countries around the world.
Forty percent of the worldâ€™s population, about 3 billion people, live in areas with a risk of dengue. Dengue is often a leading cause of illness in areas with risk.
Each year, up to 400 million people get infected with dengue. Approximately 100 million people get sick from infection, and 22, 000 die from severe dengue.
Dengue is caused by one of any of four related viruses: Dengue virus 1, 2, 3, and 4.  For this reason, a person can be infected with a dengue virus as many as four times in his or her lifetime.

## INTRODUCTION

Dengue virus infection has many manifestations, including asymptomatic symptoms, dengue fever (DF) or more severe forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in affected individuals. Biomarkers provide a dynamic and effective method for understanding diseases and can be used in observational and analytical epidemiology, randomized clinical trials, screening, diagnosis, and prognosis. When choosing the appropriate  treatment, because the vaccine has not been approved for immunization, the early prognosis is very important for patients who have no warning signs but may develop severe dengue hemorrhagic fever later. Severe reactions of dengue fever include T and B storm cell activation and cytokine apoptosis, hematological abnormalities, and complement activation. Unknown factors such as cytokines and complement can temporarily affect the endothelium and change the barrier function of body fluids causing normal endothelial cells and plasma leakage. The host factors such as complemently activated immune and endothelial cells and their products due to dengue disease can be used as biomarkers for severe dengue fever.[2](https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12929-015-0191-6 "DENV").


The severiety of dengue disease progression varies depending on the subject or individual.However the mechanism of the severe dengues disease is poorly understood. The advance of high throughput technology and capabilities to process large data which are being generated exponential can be helpful in aiding in understanding the mechanism behind the severe dengue disease. Over the course of time single cell technology have evolved and lower the cost of sequencing large genome data and also a resolution of much lower depth enabling us to analyse these hight throughput data at a single cell level. 

The major factor contribution to the  dengue pathogenesis is considered to the human immune resposes.With the help of opsonizing antibodies, DENV virus infection increases the process of plasma loss, shock and bleeding manifestations, leading to changes in the immune response, which triggers the activation of T cells and the release of cytokines and chemical mediators. Risk factors for secondary infection.<sup>[3](https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-015-0191-6#ref-CR3)</sup>


Biomarkers for early detection of SD based on molecular features of the patients blood.
**~ Early detection save lives.**

DEG analysis extracted from blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

The data consists of **4** individuals with **Dengue Positive** and **4 Dengue Negative** or Control and therefore has 8 datsets in total.<br>

Initial QC of data if of very important as it can help in identifying noises and remove these artifacts that may have adverse effect of the further downstream analysis.

The datasets was Standardize  for each same and merged for  the analysis by using **scanpy** package.<br>

Anotation of the genes and custering this highly dimensions data is required to identify groups of cells based on the similarities of the transcripts without any prior knowledge of the labels. Moreover, in most situations we do not even know the number of clusters a priori. The problem is made even more challenging due to the high level of noise (both technical and biological).

Higly variable genes were identified among the samples for further analysis.

Several biochemical compounds in the serum/plasma of patients with severe dengue fever have been shown to increase or decrease, and their quantification can be used as a biomarker of severe dengue fever. Plasma's total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein levels were also known to expressed during Dengue disease. Compared with patients with mild dengue haemorrhagic fever, children with the most severe disease have significantly lower (LDL).
